"""
WORKLOG reminder ??? a Claude Code `Stop` hook.

Fires when the agent tries to end its turn. If the git working tree has code
changes but WORKLOG.md was NOT touched this turn, it blocks the stop once and
tells the agent to record an entry. Otherwise it stays silent.

Design rules:
  - FAIL-OPEN: any error, missing git, missing python feature -> exit 0, never
    trap the user. A reminder hook must never be able to wedge a session.
  - NO DEAD-LOOP: honours `stop_hook_active` so it reminds at most once.
  - ZERO DEPENDENCIES: standard library only.
